805 Foundation is a non-profit organization operated by students who believe
in giving back to their community by redefining education.

Our organization came from humble beginnings founded in a dorm room in San
Diego State University. In our initial phases, we reached out to other
non-profit organizations to offer media services such as graphic design, web
development, and social media marketing which was then executed by SDSU
students who wanted to put the skills to the test. After a few months, 805
Foundation was able to partner with nonprofits scattered throughout the
state of California.

While still in its earliest stage 805 Foundation became a supported program
under NewCo Foundation, a non-profit conglomerate founded by serial
entrepreneur Dave Gross. Under NewCo, 805 was able to broaden its reach to
an international level such as Hack Iloilo.

805 Foundation currently partners with several student run organizations who believe in giving back to the community. We collaborate with these organizations by providing digital services, co-organizing events and programs. We also develop workshops where student can learn about web development, app development, graphic design, etc.

805 Foundation encourages students to expand their level of involvement beyond the typical classroom setting. We challenge students to solve real world problems and provide a network of industry professionals for
mentorship. Our students acquire skills and training closely similar to the
fundamental principles used in the industry. Our teams survey surrounding
companies about the tools, practices, and methodology they use which becomes
the foundation of the course content we facilitate. All of our work is
provided free to all students to give everyone the equal opportunity to
learn about their aspiring career fields.

As for our goals for the future of 805 Foundation, itâ€™s simple. We never want to stop encouraging students to gain practical skills and put it to practice.
